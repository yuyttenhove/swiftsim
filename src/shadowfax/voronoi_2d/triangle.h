/**
 * @brief Triangle.
 *
 * A triangle connects 3 points in 2D space, called the vertices of the
 * triangle. The connections between these vertices are line segments. Within
 * a Delaunay tessellation, each line segment forms the border between two
 * neighbouring triangles.
 *
 * Within this struct, we store the indices of the 3 vertices, as well as the
 * indices of the neighbouring triangles and the indices of this triangle within
 * the neighbour lists of its neighbours. The latter is done to speed up lookup
 * operations during incremental Delaunay tessellation construction.
 *
 * We use the following convention: neighbours[0] corresponds to the neighbour
 * across the line segment that connects vertices[1] and vertices[2].
 * index_in_neighbours[0] is then the position of the index of this triangle
 * within neighbours[0]->neighbours, so that
 * neighbours[0]->neighbours[index_in_neighbours[0]] is this triangle again.
