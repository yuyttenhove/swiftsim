Small LCDM cosmological simulation generated by C. Power. Cosmology
is WMAP9 and the box is 100Mpc/h in size with 64^3 particles.
We use a softening length of 1/25th of the mean inter-particle separation.

The ICs have been generated to run with Gadget-2 so we need to switch
on the options to cancel the h-factors and a-factors at reading time.
We generate gas from the ICs using SWIFT's internal mechanism and set the
temperature to the expected gas temperature at this redshift.

This example is intended to be run with the EAGLE-XL model in order to
produce lightcone outputs including gas, stars and black holes. Note 
that the resulting output will not be at all realistic due to the extremely
poor mass resolution and the minimum overdensity for star formation has
to be be reduced to allow any star formation.

To configure the code appropriately, the following flags should be included:

./configure \
    --with-hydro=sphenix \
    --with-subgrid=EAGLE-XL \
    --with-kernel=wendland-C2 \
    --with-chealpix \
    --enable-lightcone
